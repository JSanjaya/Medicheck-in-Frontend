## Project Overview:
I want to reduce stigma behind taking medication for illness, especially for mental illness/wellbeing. I come from a place that doesn't really recognize the importance of mental health but rather stigmatizes the overall subject matter. Due to this, many people who have access to prescribed medicine for their mental health are so affected by the stigma that they are discouraged from asking for or receiving the help they deserve. With my application, I hope to encourage people who want to take medication to improve their overall health. I also want to assure people that it is okay to not take their medication. Ultimately it comes down to that person's choice and I want to foster a safe environment where people don't feel judged, no matter what they decide. Being able to journal your progress allows people to visualize their milestones and measure their progress. Creating a friendly web-app accessible to anyone will allow people to achieve this goals, whatever they may be.

This application still needs a lot of work in terms of design and UX/UI flows. 
Medication is a private subject matter for many people which is why UX/UI is an extremely important factor for building this web-app. We need to approach this overall subject with great sensitivity so users can feel comfortable and safe free from any triggers.

Project includes a authentication and authorization system which hashes the user's sensitive details while maintaining a session through cookies and a JSON web token. This is extremely important since we are storing delicate and sensitive user details.

Future ToDos:
- Allow users to customize what their Taken/Abstain pages look like
- Allow users to view their entries in a seperate page
- Allow users to exit their current pages (adding a back button for pages)
- Allow users to edit their entries
- Improve responsiveness accross all browsers and screen sizes (especially mobile)
- Better Password Validation

Future ideas:
- Create a mobile app since most people would prefer journalling their progress on their devices on the go.
